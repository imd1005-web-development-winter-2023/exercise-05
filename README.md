# Exercise 05 - HTML

Welcome to exercise 05 - let's build a whole page.

## Steps

1. Create a folder on your local machine to work in and open it up in VSCode
2. Create an `index.html` file in your local working folder
3. Copy the contents of the `index.html` file in this repository into your newly created `index.html` file
4. Using your knowledge of HTML forms, build a form that allows a user to input the following data: Full name, Email, Student number, Slides for How are you feeling, and a date input for expected graduation date, and radio buttons for the ratings inside a fieldset
5. Add appropriate `id` and `for` and `name` attributes to the form elements
6. Add a `<button>` element that is of type reset and has the button text "Reset form"
7. Add a `<button>` element that is of type submit and has the button text "Submit your response"
8. Use the screen capture / image below to help you with the form. Your page should look something close to it at the end of the exercise
9. **Bonus 1:** Add `autocomplete` attributes to the name and email inputs
10. **Bonus 2:** Make the Expected Graduation Date field required by both adding the text "required" and also adding the `required` attribute
11. If you get stuck, have a look inside the `\solutions` folder for one way of putting this together

## Final

Note: depending on what browser you are using your form elements may look slightly different
